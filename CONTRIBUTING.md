# Contributing

This extension is based on the [Template for VS Code Python tools extensions](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-tools-extension-template).

## Development

### Getting Started

- Install [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- Install [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), or see the `justfile` for corresponding commands.
- Create and activate a virtual environment (e.g., `uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate`).
- Install development dependencies (`just install`).
- To automatically format the codebase, run: `just fmt`.
- To run lint and type checks, run: `just check`.
- To run tests, run: `just test`.

To run the extension, navigate to `src/extension.ts` and run (`F5`). You should see the LSP output
and Python log messages in the debug console under "Python Server".

### Modifying the LSP

- Clone [ruff-lsp](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp) to, e.g., `../ruff-lsp`.
- In `../ruff-lsp`, run: `uv pip install -t ../ruff-vscode/bundled/libs/ -e .`.

### Using a custom version of ruff

- Clone [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) to, e.g., `/home/ferris/ruff`.
- Run `cargo build` in the Ruff repository.
- Set "Ruff: Path" to `/home/ferris/ruff/target/debug/ruff` in the VS Code settings.

## Release

- Make sure you have Python 3.7 installed and locatable by uv.
  (If you're using pyenv, you may need to run `pyenv local 3.7`.)
- Run `uv run --python=3.7 scripts/release.py`.
  (Run `uv run --python=3.7 scripts/release.py --help` for information on what this script does,
  and its various options.)
- Check the changes the script made, copy-edit the changelog, and commit the changes.
- Create a new PR and merge it.
- [Create a new Release](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode/releases/new), enter `x.x.x` (where `x.x.x` is the new version) into the _Choose a tag_ selector. Click _Generate release notes_, curate the release notes and publish the release.
- The Release workflow publishes the extension to the VS Code marketplace.
